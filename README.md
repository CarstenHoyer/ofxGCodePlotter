# ofxGCodePlotter
ofxGCodePlotter is an "ofPath to GCode" converter. It is currently very alpha and misses a lot of functionality.

ofxGCodePlotter will _never_ be a GCode library. I personally only use it for converting ofPaths in 2D into one layer GCode.

## Usage
* Install the addon like any other openFrameworks addon. ofxGCodePlotter uses ofxCubicBezierToBiarc to convert cubic bezier curves to arcs - so that addon will also be pulled in.

* Next copy the example config file and adjust the settings as needed.

* Then create an instance of ofxGCodePlotter like so: `ofxGCodePlotter gcode = ofxGCodePlotter('path/to/config', width, height);`.

* Feed it with a vector of ofPaths: `vector<GCodePath> paths = gcode.generate(shapes);`

* Print to the console: ``gcode.print(paths);

## Limitations / Roadmap
* Print filled paths (hatching).
* Cut paths under a filled path.
* Do not print off canvas content.
* Inject a tool.
* Feed rate.
